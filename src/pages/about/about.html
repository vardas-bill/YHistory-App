  The World Image Archive (WIA) is possibly the most ambitious photographic project ever undertaken.
<br /><br />
  WIA collects location and time specific images of events,  the natural world, and architecture from all over the globe, from people like you. It is an ongoing record of the world and our place in it.
  <br /><br />
  Have you taken a photo you think others might like to see? Put it in the World Image Archive.
  <br /><br />
  Want to record a personal event for posterity? Put it in the World Image Archive.
  <br /><br />
  The World Image Archive gives you the opportunity to share your images with a global audience, and to have an audience for your images long after you are gone. To have personal events and experiences recorded for posterity.
  <br /><br />
  The archive will grow over the coming months, years, decades, centuries and beyond to become the largest archive  of location based images ever assembled. We are nothing if not ambitious!
  <br /><br />
  You can see all of WIA's images on an interactive timeline map of the world at the <a href="http://www.worldimagearchive.com">World Image Archive</a> website. The images form an ongoing commentary of our world and our place in it. The images are available for anyone to see including the curious, social historians, and others with an interest in our world and how we live our lives.
  <br /><br />
  We invite you to add your own images to the archive. To record your experiences, and the world around you, for current and future generations to see.
  <br /><br />
  The WIA is currently open to submissions of images of events, the natural world, and architecture. In the future we will start accepting other categories of image, as well as promoting specific image based projects.
  <br /><br />
  The only requirement for an image to be eligible for the archive is that it must contain location and date information, and not contain any illegal material.
  <br /><br />
  Everyone is invited and encouraged to contribute to the archive. Irrespective of their photographic ability!
  <br /><br />
  Your contributions to the archive will be held indefinitely and will be visible to anyone anywhere in the world. Pinned at a particular time and place they form part of an eternal visual footprint.
